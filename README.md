# Cradle: Multi-Modal AI Baby Monitoring System

## **Project Overview**

**Cradle** is a multimodal baby monitoring system that uses React Native with a PyTorch backend. The app streams real-time audio and video from a caregiverâ€™s phone, while the backend processes those streams to detect crying, unusual motion, or other events of interest. 

Models trained in PyTorch and optimized with ONNX Runtime handle audio classification and video activity recognition. Data flows through Apache Kafka for scalable streaming, and predictions are served via a FastAPI service. The system sends instant alerts to caregivers through Firebase Cloud Messaging, while all services are containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS ECS

**Key Achievement**: Successfully architected and deployed an end-to-end ML system handling real-time audio/video streams with sub-second latency across mobile and cloud platforms.
